# predicting_diabetic_model
This project predicts diabetes using open health datasets and compares multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and other metrics to identify the most effective approach for early diabetes detection.
